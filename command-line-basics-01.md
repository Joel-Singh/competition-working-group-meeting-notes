# DU Code Competition Group: Command Line Basics
Welcome to the first meeting for the DU Code Competition Group!

---

# What You'll Learn

- Structure a real C++ project with CMake (how do I actually do C++ outside my
classes?)
- Collaboration with Git
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Ship code for value

---

# Is Everyone In The Discord?
- Join the discord
- What is your username?

---

# The Beginning Weeks: Linux and the Command Line

- You will learn about **Linux** and the **Command Line**
- **Linux** is an operating system geared towards developers
- The **Command Line** is a powerful textual way to interact with a computer
- Coding Competitions are developed on Linux using command line tools
- The command line helps to solve the question of "how do I start my own C++ project?"

---

# Linux

- Every computer runs an operating system, Linux is one such.
- Designed for development
- Coding Competitions will be developed on Linux
- You'll use the lab for tasks I assign and to work on Coding Competitions

Fun fact: most servers run Linux. Many developers write code on MacOS and
Windows machines to be deployed on Linux servers.

---

# The Command Line Interface (CLI)

- A purely textual way to interact with a computer
- More powerful than a GUI
- Many developer tools run on just the CLI
- A prominent tool `git` uses a CLI, which you'll learn
- Our "build system" (CMake) runs on the command line

---

# The Odin Project (TOP)

- Online Web Developer Curriculum
- The first Tasks will be general concept TOP lessons

Let's start learning Linux and the command line!

---

# Your First Command

1. Open the terminal
2. Type `whoami`

The terminal includes a bunch of commands you can just type.

---

# Files and Directories

- Your computer is made up of files and directories (folders)
- The first things you'll learn are to manipulate files and directories on the command line
- On the terminal, you have a "current working directory"
- You can see it with `pwd`. Run `pwd`, what do you see?

The current working directory is used by commands you invoke.

---

## ls

- The `ls` command _lists_ things in the current working directory
- Try running `ls`. What do you see?

---

## mkdir

- The `mkdir`, well, makes a directory
- Try running `mkdir my-new-fantastical-directory`. Then run `ls`. Do you see
your new directory?

---

## cd

- `cd` will "change directory"
1. Try `cd my-new-fantastical-directory`
2. Now, what does `pwd` output?

Notice that `cd` took in an _argument_. Kind of like a function.

---

## touch

- `touch` will create a new file
- Try `touch cool-and-awesome-file`
- What is the output of `ls` now?

---

# Reading for next time
- Go through this TOP lesson:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics
- TOP links to lessons by "Software Carpentry". Only read through "Download
Files", "Introducing The Shell", and "Navigating Files and Directories". You
will do the rest next time.
- Skip the "Challenges" in the Software Carpentry lessons.

Use the Linux Lab at your leisure to follow along with the reading.

---

# Logistics

- Next meeting will be after break, on Sunday from 7 to 8 pm, January 25th
- As you have questions for the reading, direct them to #competition-group-questions in discord. I'll be checking it regularly.

---

# End

- Happy Hacking!
